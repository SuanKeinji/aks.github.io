        In the past, San Roque Church’s mother parish is the church in Opon (currently, Lapulapu City). <br>
         It gained parochial status on October 8, 1864. The Order of Augustinian Recollects administered the parish in the beginning, starting with Fr. Jose Salazar, OAR as the first parish priest. In 1909, its administration passed to the Redemptorists and to the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart since 1939. <br>
          The church’s history dates back to the Spanish colonial period. It was during this time that Christianity was introduced to the Philippines, and many churches were built across the country. San Roque Church is one of these historical structures that have stood the test of time.
