        <p class="p">The Entoy’s bakasihan is one of the oldest restaurant serving bakasi in town as the area is abundant with reef eels <br>
             because the sea’s tidal flats are mostly grassy and muddy which are conducive to the eel’s sustenance.</p>
        <img class="pic4" src="image/img/e4.jpg" alt="">  
        <p class="p1">One of the main dish is their specialty dish is the Linarang Bakasi (Sour Stew with Reef Eels), which is a perfectly-cooked eel sautéed in soy sauce, green mangoes, <br>
             fermented black beans, and soured with tamarind and other secret spices. <br>
              <br> 
            Fried Bakasi – crispylicious fried fish which you can easily eat its bone. Taste better when dipped on sauce (combination of soy sauce, vinegar/calamansi & chili). <br>
            <br>
            Saang – they steamed it and the saltiness from the ocean make it a great sign that t’was freshly caught. <br>
            <br>
            These are just some of the many dish to try out something extraordinary with your friends and family, have a stopover here and enjoy the cool breeze of the sea.
